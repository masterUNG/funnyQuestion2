    <string name="u1styleText5">Warm-up</string>
    <string name="u1styleText6">1. What is a computer?</string>
    <string name="u1styleText7">A computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of instruction stored in its own memory, that can accept data, process the data according to specified rules, produce results, and store the results for the future use.</string>
    <string name="u1styleText8">2. How do you use computers in your free time?</string>

    <string name="u1styleText20">What is a computer?</string>
    <string name="u1styleText21">A computer is an electronic machine which can accept data in a certain form, process the data, and give the results of the processing in a specified format as information.</string>
    <string name="u1styleText22">First, data is fed into the computer’s memory. Then when the program is run, the computer performs a set of instructions and processes the data. Finally, we can see the results (the output) on the screen or in printed form (see Fig below)</string>
    <string name="u1styleText23">A computer system consists of two parts: hardware and software.</string>
    <string name="u1styleText24"><b>Hardware</b> is any electronic or mechanical part you can see or touch.</string>
    <string name="u1styleText25"><b>Software</b> is a set of instructions, called a program, which tells the computer what to do.</string>
    <string name="u1styleText26"><b>Software</b> There are three basic hardware sections: <b>the central processing unit ( CPU)</b>, <b>main memory</b> and <b>peripherals</b>. Perhaps the most influential component is the central processing unit. Its function is to program instructions and coordinate the activities of all the other units. I a way, it is the “brain off the computer. The main memory ( a collection of RAM chips) holds the instructions and data which are being processed by the CPU. Peripherals are the physical units attracted to the computer. The include storage devices and input/ output devices.</string>
    <string name="u1styleText27">The components of a computer</string>
    <string name="u1styleText28">are Input devices, Output devices, System unit, Storage devices and Communication devices.</string>
    <string name="u1styleText29">Input</string>
    <string name="u1styleText30">is any data and instruction entered into the memory of a computer. As shown in Figure below, people have a variety of options for entering data and instructions into a computer.</string>
    <string name="u1styleText31">Output Devices</string>
    <string name="u1styleText32">An output device is any hardware component that conveys information to one or more people. Three commonly used output devices are a printer, a monitor and speakers.</string>
    <string name="u1styleText33">A printer produces text and graphics on a physical medium such as paper. A monitor displays text, graphics, and videos on a screen. Speakers allow you to hear music, voice and other audio (sounds)</string>
    <string name="u1styleText34">System Unit</string>
    <string name="u1styleText35">The system unit is a cast that contains the electronic components of the computer that are used to process data. The circuitry of the system unit usually is part of or is connected to a circuit board called the motherboard.</string>
    <string name="u1styleText36">Two main components on the motherboard are the processor and memory: The process also called a CPU ( central processing unit) , is the electronic component that interprets and carries out the basic instructions that operate the computer. Memory consisted of electronic component, most memory keeps data and instructions temporarily, which means its contents are erased when the computer is shut off.)</string>
    <string name="u1styleText37">Storage Devices</string>
    <string name="u1styleText38">Storage holds data, instructions, and information for future use. For example, computers can store hundred or millions of customer names and address. Storage holds these items permanently.</string>
    <string name="u1styleText39">A computer keeps data, instructions, and information on storage media. Examples of storage media are USB flash drives, hard disks, optical discs, and memory cards. A storage device records (writes( and / or retrieves (reads) items to and from storage media. Drives and readers/ writers, which are ty0es of storage devices.</string>
    <string name="u1styleText40">Communication devices</string>
    <string name="u1styleText41">A communication device is a hardware component that enables a computer to sent (transmit) and receive data, instructions, and information to and from one or more computers or mobile devices. A widely used communications device is a modern.</string>
    <string name="u1styleText42">Communications occur over cables, telephone lines, cellular radio networks, satellites and other transmission media. Some transmission media such as satellites and cellular radio networks, are wireless, which means they have no physical lines or wires.</string>

    <string name="u2styleText14">2. Label the parts of computer</string>

    <string name="u2styleText15">Presentation</string>
    <string name="u2styleText16">1. What is inside a PC system?</string>
    <string name="u2styleText17">The nerve center of a PC is the processor, also called the CPU, or central processing unit. This is built into a single chip which executes program instructions and coordinates. The activities that take place within the computer system. The chip itself is a small piece of silicon with a complex electrical circuit called integrated circuit.</string>
    <string name="u2styleText18">The processor consists of three main parts:</string>
    <string name="styleText4"><b>Direction:</b> Match the words with pictures.</string>
    <string name="styleText4a">\tmouse\t\t\t\t\ttower\t\t\t\t\t\tmonitor\n\tcd rom\t\t\t\t\tkeyboard\t\t\theadset\n\tspeakers\t\t\tscanner\t\t\t\tprinter</string>
    <string name="styleText5"><b>The control unit</b> examines the instructions in the user’s program, in the user’s program, interprets each instruction and causes the circuits and the rest of the components-monitor disk drivers, etc-to execute the functions specified.</string>
    <string name="styleText6"><b>The arithmetic logic unit (ALU)</b>  performs mathematical calculations (+, -, etc) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT)</string>
    <string name="styleText7"><b>The registers</b> are high-speed units of memory used to store and control data. One of the registers (the program counter, or PC) keeps track of the next instruction to be performed in the main memory. The other (the instruction register, or IR) holds the instruction that is being executed.</string>
    <string name="styleText8">The power and performance of a computer is partly determined by the speed of its processor. <b>A system clock</b> sends out signals at fixed intervals to measure and synchronize the low of data. <b>Clock speed</b> is measured in gigahertz (GHz). For example, a CPU running at 4GHz (four thousand million hertz, or cycles, per second) will enable your PC to handle the most demanding applications.</string>
    <string name="styleText9">RAM and ROM</string>
    <string name="styleText10">The programs and data which pass through the processor must be loaded into the main memory in order to be processed. Therefore, when the user runs a program, the CPU looks for it on the hard disk and transfer a copy into the <b>RAM</b> chips. RAM(random access memory) is volatile-that is, its information is lost when the computer is turned off. However, <b>ROM</b> (read only memory) is non-volatile, containing instructions and routines for the basic operations of the CPU. The <b>BIOS</b> (basic input/ output system) uses ROM to control communication with peripherals.</string>
    <string name="styleText11">RAM capacity can be expanded by adding extra chips, usually contained in small circuit boards called dual in-line memory modules <b>(DIMMs)</b>.</string>
    <string name="styleText12">Buses and cards</string>
    <string name="styleText13">The man circuit board inside your system is called the <b>motherboard</b> and contains the processor, the memory chips, expansions slots, and controllers for peripherals, connected by <b>buses</b>-electrical channels which allow devices inside the computer to communicate with each other. For example, the front side bus carries all data that passes from the CPU to other devices.</string>
    <string name="styleText14">The size of a bus, called <b>bus width</b>, determines how much data can be transmitted. It can be compared to the number of lanes on a motorway-the larger the width, the more data can travel along the bus. For example, a 64-bit bus can transmit 64 bits of data.</string>
    <string name="styleText15"><b>Expansion</b> slots allow users to install <b>expansion cards</b>, adding features like sound, memory and network capabilities.</string>
    <string name="styleText16">2. Using the Keyboard and Mouse</string>
    <string name="styleText17">2.1 What is computer keyboard?</string>
    <string name="styleText18">The keyboard is the piece of <u>computer hardware</u> used to input text, characters, and other commands into a computer or similar device. Even though the keyboard is an external <u>peripheral device</u> in a desktop system (it sits outside the main <u>computer housing</u>), or is \"virtual\" in a tablet PC, it is an essential part of the complete computer system.</string>
    <string name="styleText19">A standard keyboard</string>
    <string name="styleText20">1. Cursor control keys include arrow keys that move that insertion point up, down, right and left, and keys such as End, Home, Page Up and Page Down, which are used in word processing to move around a long document.</string>
    <string name="styleText21">2. Alphanumeric keys represent letters and numbers, as arranged on a typewriter.</string>
    <string name="styleText22">3. Function keys appear at the top of the keyboard and can be programmed to do special tasks.</string>
    <string name="styleText23">4. Dedicated keys are used to issue commands or to produce alternative character, e.g. the <i>Ctrl key</i> or the <i>Alt key.</i></string>
    <string name="styleText24">5.A numeric keypad appears to the right of the main keyboard. The <i>NumLock key</i> is used to switch from numbers to editing keys.</string>
    <string name="styleText25">2.2 What is a computer mouse?</string>
    <string name="styleText26">The computer mouse is an input device. It lets us tell the computer what we want by pressing on it. We call it a mouse because it looks like a real mouse. A component mouse is made up of three parts as follows; body, cable and buttons.</string>
    <string name="styleText27">When we look at the computer screen we see an arrow or a shape that moves with the mouse. This is the <b>CURSOR.</b> To tell the computer what to do, we first <b>POINT</b> the cursor by moving the mouse. Then when the cursor is where we want it, we press the button or <b>CLICK.</b></string>
    <string name="styleText28">3. How to scan an image?</string>
    <string name="styleText29">1. Make sure the scanner is connected to the computer.</string>
    <string name="styleText30">2. Lift the lid and put the original on the scanner glass.</string>
    <string name="styleText31">3. For high image quality, scan at 300 or higher.</string>
    <string name="styleText32">4. The scanning software will automatically do a preview.</string>
    <string name="styleText33">5. If the image is too dark or too light, you can adjust the brightness and contrast.</string>
    <string name="styleText34">6. Click \"scan\".</string>
    <string name="styleText35">7. If the scanned text, it can be \"read\" by OCR software.</string>
    <string name="styleText36">8. If you want to save the image, choose a file format JPEG is a good choice for photos.</string>
    <string name="styleText37">9. The scanned image can be manipulated using image editing software.</string>
    <string name="styleText38">10. An all-in-one printer/scanner can print, scan and copy.</string>
    <string name="styleText39">Picture A is a <b>handheld scanner.</b></string>
    <string name="styleText40">Picture B is a <b>flatbed scanner.</b></string>
    <string name="styleText40a"><b>Picture A:</b> https://precisionsecuritysystems.com/product/handheld-scanner</string>

    <string name="styleText41">4. Printing</string>
    <string name="styleText42">How to set up a new printer</string>
    <string name="styleText43">Here are the basic steps you’ll follow to set up almost any printer.</string>
    <string name="styleText44">Plug in the printer’s power cable and make sure it’s turned on.</string>
    <string name="styleText45">1. Plug in the printer’s power cable and make sure it’s turned on.</string>
    <string name="styleText46">2. Connect the included cable (usually a USB cable) from the printer to the computer.</string>
    <string name="styleText47"><b>Note:</b> The process will be different if you’re using a wireless printer.</string>
    <string name="styleText48">3. On your computer, locate the printer settings. If you’re using a windows computer, you’ll find these in the <b>Control Panel.</b> If you’re using a Mac, you’ll them in <b>System Preferences.</b></string>
    <string name="styleText49">4. Look for the option to Add a printer, then follow the instructions that appear.</string>
    <string name="styleText50">5. Now it\'s time to try printing something! For example, you could try printing <u>this test page.</u> After you click the link, select <b>File > Print</b> your web browser\'s menu, or simply press <b>Ctrl+P</b> on your keyboard (or <p>Command+P</p> if you\'re on a Mac).></string>
    <string name="styleText51">6. A dialog box will appear. Locate and select the new printer from the list, then click Print.</string>
    <string name="styleText52">7. The item will then be printed . But if it doesn\'t work, don’t panic! You can try using some of the solutions to common the problems below.</string>
    <string name="styleText53"><b>Solutions to common problems</b></string>
    <string name="styleText54"><b>Problem: Nothing happens when you try to print.</b> are several reasons a printer might not work, even if everything\'s connected properly. First, you\'ll want to make sure you\'ve put paper into the correct tray and there\'sno paper stuck inside the printer.</string>
    <string name="styleText55"><b>Problem: The printer has paper and nothing\'s stuck, but it still won\'t print.</b> If the solutions above don\'t work, <b>try canceling the print job</b> from the computer and trying again. Many printers also have a button you can use to restart the current job. If all else fails, try turning the printer off and on again to see if it fixes the problem.</string>
    <string name="styleText56"><b>Problem: The printer works, but the text is very light and difficult to read.</b> If this happens, it probably means your printer requires a new <b>ink cartridge</b>   to keep working. The instruction manual included with the printer should note what type of cartridge you\'ll need to buy.</string>
    <string name="styleText57">Practice</string>
    <string name="styleText58"><b>1. Direction:</b> Read the text above and then answer these questions.</string>

    <string name="u4styleText32">1. The internet’s History</string>
    <string name="u4styleText33">The internet, also called the Net, is a worldwide collection of networks that links millions of businesses, government agencies, educational institutions, and individuals. The Internet has its roots in ARPANET, a network started in 1969 to link scientific and academic researchers across the United States. In 1986, the National Science Foundation connected its huge network, called NSF net, to ARPANET, creating a configuration of complex networks and hosts that became known as the Internet. Today, more than 550 million bostcomputers connect to the Internet.</string>
    <string name="u4styleText34">2. What are the various types of the Internet connections?</string>
    <string name="u4styleText35">Many home and small business users connect to the Internet via high-speed broadband Internet service. With broadband Internet service, your computer or mobile device usually is connected to the Internet the entire time it is powered on. Examples of broadband Internet service include cable, DSL, fiber, radio signals and satellite.</string>
    <string name="u4styleText37">- <b>Cable Internet service</b> provides high-speed Internet access through the cable television network via a cable modern.</string>
    <string name="u4styleText39">- <b>DSL. (digital subscriber line)</b> provides high-speed Internet connection using regular copper telephone lines.</string>
    <string name="u4styleText41">- <b>Fiber to the Premises (FTTP)</b> uses fiber-optic cable to provide high-speed Internet access to home and business users.</string>
    <string name="u4styleText43">- <b>Fixed wireless</b> offers high-speed Internet connections using a dish-shaped antenna on your house or business to communicate with a tower location via radio signals.</string>
    <string name="u4styleText45">- <b>A cellular radio network</b> high-speed Internet connections to devices with built-in compatible technology or computers with wireless moderns.</string>
    <string name="u4styleText47">- <b>A Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity)</b> network uses radio signals to provide high-speed Internet connections to compatible or properly equipped wireless computers and devices.</string>
    <string name="u4styleText48">3. What are the types of Internet Access providers?</string>
    <string name="u4styleText49">An access provider is a business that provides access to the Internet free of for a fee.</string>
    <string name="u4styleText51">- <b>An ISP (Internet service provider)</b> is a regional or national access provider.</string>

    <string name="u4styleText55">- <b>A wireless Internet service provider</b> provides wireless Internet access to desktop and notebook computers and mobile devices with built-in wireless capabilities (such as Wi&#45;Fi) or to computers using wireless moderns or wireless access devices.</string>
    <string name="u4styleText56">4. Internet Addresses</string>
    <string name="u4styleText57">What is the purpose of an IP Address, and what is its relationship to a domain name?</string>
    <string name="u4styleText59">- <b>An IP address (Internet Protocol address)</b> is a number that uniquely identifies each computer of device connected to the Internet. The internet relies on IP addresses to send data to computers at specific locations. The IP address usually consists of four groups of numbers, each separated by a period.</string>
    <string name="u4styleText61">- <b>A domain name</b> is the text version of an IP address.</string>
    <string name="u4styleText62"><![CDATA[IP address ==> 72.14.207.99]]></string>
    <string name="u4styleText63"><![CDATA[Domain name ==> www.google.com]]></string>

    <string name="u4styleText89b">6. What\'s the difference between the Web and the internet?</string>
    <string name="u4styleText89c">Some people think that the internet and the Web are the same thing, but in fact they are different. The internet (often called simply \"the net\") is a global network of interconnected computers. These computers communicate with each other over existing telecommunications networks – principally, the telephone system. The Word Wide Web (usually known as just \"the Web\") is the billions of web pages that are stored on large computers called web servers. To access the web, you need a computer and a modem. You then connect over your telephone line to an internet service provider (ISP), which sends your request to view a particular web page to the correct web server. Websites are not the only service available on the internet. It is also used for many other functions, including sending and receiving email, and connecting to newsgroups and 6 discussion groups. You could say that the internet is a system of roads, and web pages and emails are types of traffic that travel on those roads.</string>

    <string name="u4styleText92">- <b>A search engine</b> is a program that finds Web sites, web pages, images, videos, news, maps and other information related to a specific topic. To use a search engine, you enter a word or phrase, called search text or a search query, that describes the item you want to find. Each word in the search text is known as a keyword. The search engine displays a list of bits. When clicked, each hit displays an associated Web site our Web page. A subject directory classifies Web pages in an organized set of categories and related subcategories. By clicking links, you move through levels to display a list of Web pages about a desired topic.</string>

    <string name="Unit5styleText9">Presentation</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText10">1. What is the purpose of the components required for successful communications, and what are various sending and receiving devices?</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText11"><b>Computer communication</b> describes a process in which two or more computers or devices transfer data, instructions and information. Successful communications requires <b>a sending device</b> that initiates a transmission instruction, a communications device that connects the sending device to a communications channel to a receiving device, and <b>a receiving device</b> that accepts the transmission of data, instructions, or information. All types of computers and mobile devices serve as sending and receiving devices in a communication system</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText11a">Communications system</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText11b"><b>Picture source:</b> https://techsources.us/communication-software/</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText12">2. How are computer communications used?</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText13">Communications technologies include blogs, chat rooms, e-mail, fax, FTP, instant messaging , newsgroups, RSS, video conferencing, VoIP, Web, Web folders, and wikis. Users can send and receive wireless messages to and from smart phones, cell phones, handheld game consoles, and other mobile devices using <b>text messaging, picture messaging</b> and <b>video messaging,</b> and <b>wireless instant messaging.</b></string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText14">People connect wirelessly to the Internet through <b>a wireless Internet access point.</b> A bot spot is a wireless net-work that provides Internet connection to mobile computers and devices. <b>A cybercafé</b> is a coffeehouse, restaurant, or other location that provides computers with Internet access. <b>A global positioning system (GPS)</b> analyzes signals sent by satellites to determine and earth-based receiver’s geographic location. Many software products provide a means to collaborate, or work online with other users connected to a server. <b>Groupware</b> is a software that helps groups of people work on projects or share information over a net-work . <b>Voice mail</b> allows someone to leave a voice massage for one or more people. Web services describe standardized software that enables programmers to create applications that communicate with other remote computers.</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText15">3. What are the advantages of using a Network, and how are LANs, MANs, and WANs different?</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText16"><b>A network</b> is a collection of computers and devices connected together via communications devices and transmission media. Advantages of using a network include facilitating communications, sharing hardware, sharing data and information, sharing software and transferring funds.</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText17">Networks typically are classified as a <b>local area network (LAN),</b> which connects computers in devices in a limited geographical area; <b>a metropolitan area network (MAN),</b> which covers a large geographic area using a communications channel that combines many types of media.</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText18"><b>A wide area network (WAN)</b> is a network that converts a large geographic area (such as a city, country, or the world) using a communication channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines, cables, and radio waves. A Wan can be on large network on can consist of two or more LANs connected together. The Internet is the world’s largest WAN.</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText19">An example of a WAN</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText20">4. How are a client/ server and peer-to-peer Networks different, and how does a P2P Network work?</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText21">On <b>a client/ server network,</b> one or more computers are as a server, sometimes called a bust computer, which controls access to network resources and provides a centralized storage area, while the other computers and devices on the network are <b>clients</b> that rly on the server for resources. <b>A peer-to-peer network</b> is a simple network that typically connects fewer than 10 computers that have equal responsibilities and capabilities. <b>P2P</b> is and Internet peer-to peer network on which users access each other’s hard disks directly and exchange files over the Internet.</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText22">On a client /server network, one or more computes act as a server, and the clients access the server(s).</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText23">Each computer on a peer-to-peer network shares its hardware and software with other computer on the network.</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText24">5. How are a star network, Bus network, and Ring network different?</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText25"><b>A network topology</b> refers to the layout of computers and devices in a communications network. There commonly used network topologies are the star bus, and ring. On <b>a star network,</b> all computers and devices on the network connect to a central device, thus forming a star. <b>A bus network</b> consists of a single central cable so which all computers and other devices connect. <b>On a ring network,</b> a cable forms a closed loop (ring) with all computers and devices arranged along the ring.</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText26">6. A star network contains a single, centralized hub or switch through.</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText27">Devices in a bus network share a single data path.</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText27a">On a ring network, all connected devices from a continuous loop.</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText28">7. What are various Network Communication Standards?</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText29">A network standard defines guidelines that specify the way computers access a medium, the type(s) of networks, and the type of physical cable or wireless technology used. Network communications standards include the following. <b>Ethernet</b> specifies that no central compute or device on the network should control when data can be transmitted. <b>Token ring</b> requires devices to share or pass a special signal, called a token. <b>TCP/ IP</b>  divides data into packets. <b>Wi-Fi</b> identifies any network based on the 802.11standards for wireless communications. <b>Bluetooth</b> uses short-rang radio waves to transmit data. <b>UWB</b> specifies how to UWB devices use short-rang radio wave to communicate at high speeds. <b>IrDa</b> transmits data wirelessly via infrared light waves. <b>RFID</b> uses radio signals for communications. <b>WiMAX</b> is a network standard developed by IEEE, that specifies how wireless devices communicate over the air in a wide area. The <b>Wireless Application Protocol (WAP)</b> specifies how some mobile devices can devices can display Internet content.</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText30">How Electronic RFID Toll Collection Works</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText30a"><b>Step 1</b> Motorist purchases an RFID transponder or RFID tag and attaches it to the vehicle\'s windshield.</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText30b"><b>Step 2</b> As the vehicle approaches the tollbooth, the RFID reader in the tollbooth sends a radio wave that activates the windshield-mounted RFID tag. The activated tag sends vehicle information to the RFID reader.</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText30c"><b>Step 3</b> The RFID reader sends the vehicle information to the lane controller. The lane controller, which is part of a local area network, transmits the vehicle information to central computer that subtracts the toll from the motorist\'s account. If the vehicle does not have an RFID tag, a high speed camera takes a picture of the license plate and the computer points a violation notice, which is mailed to the motorist. </string>

    <string name="Unit5styleText32">Communication software helps users establish a connection to another computer or network; manages the transmission of data, instructions, and information; and provides and interface for users to communicate with one another.</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText33">9. What are commonly used communications devices?</string>
    <string name="Unit5styleText34">A communications device is hardware capable of transmitting data between a sending device and a receiving device. A dial modem converts digital signals to analog signals and analog signals to digital signals so that data can travel along analog telephone lines. A digital modem sends and receives data and information to and from a digital line. An ISDN modem transits digital data to and from an ISDN line, while a <b>DSL, modem</b> transmits digital data to and from a DSL line. A <b>cable modem,</b> sometimes called a broadband modem, is a digital modem that sends and receives digital data over the cable television network. A <b>wireless modem</b> uses the cell phone network to connect to the Internet wirelessly from mobile computers an devices. A network card enables a computer and device that does not have built-in-networking capability to access a network. A wireless access point allows computers and devices to transfer data wirelessly. A router connects multiple computers or other routers together and transmits data to it correct destination on the network. A bub or switch is a device that provides a central point for cables in a network.</string>
